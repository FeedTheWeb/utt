# CHANGES
    * PULLED LATEST argcomplete FROM GITHUB FOR append_space= KEYWORD ARG IN argcomplete.autocomplete()
    * FILENAME / DATA-DIR FUNCTIONS TO util.py FOR ACCESSIBILITY OUTSIDE OF main
    * CUSTOM AUTOCOMPLETER FOR cmd_add.py FOR POPULATING FROM TASK HISTORY
    * 'DESCRIPTION' ATTRIBUTE FOR EACH cmd_ MODULE FOR ENHANCED argparse HELP ON SUBCOMMANDS
    * CONFIGURED LOGGING IN main() TO CAPTURE ANY AUTOCOMPLETE PROBLEMS (argcomplete CAPTURES STDERR)
    * CHECK FOR DEBIAN DEFAULT EDITOR /usr/bin/editor WHEN $VISUAL AND $EDITOR ARE NOT SET BEFORE FALLING BACK TO vi
    * ADDED STRING 'PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK' TO FIRST 1024 BYTES OF MAIN SCRIPT IN bin/ TO BE USED WITH GLOBAL ARGCOMPLETE IF ENABLED IN /etc/profile

# QUESTIONS
    * FOR CONSISTENCY, WE SHOULD EITHER PULL BOTH argcomplete/argparse FROM PIP, OR INCLUDE BOTH UNDER utt/.  PREFERENCE?
    * JUST PARSING THE WHOLE utt.log FOR AUTOCOMPLETE NOW.  FAST ENOUGH ON MY SIDE, BUT MY LOG IS SMALL.  IS IT FAST ENOUGH ON YOUR SIDE?
